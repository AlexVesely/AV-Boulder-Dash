## Intro

This repository is a copy of my group's implementation of Boulder Dash. My group's repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/Karamveer9200/Boulder-Dash-Remake">here!</a> 

Boulder Dash is a classic 1984 Atari game. The player digs through dirt-filled caves, collecting diamonds while avoiding falling rocks and enemies, with the goal of reaching the exit before time runs out.

This repository is a showcase of our game and my work.

## Set up

I chose not to package an executable because I want this repository to highlight the actual source code and JavaFX setup

### Requirements
- JDK 21
- JavaFX SDK 21.0.5

### Steps

*Steps shown are based on IntelliJ IDEA. Other IDEs will follow a similar process.*

1) Clone this repository into your IDE as a Java Project.
2) Download <a href="https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/">JavaFX SDK 21.0.5</a>  and save it somewhere accessible on your computer.
3) In your IDE, go to Project Structure and add both the lib folder from JavaFX SDK and the src folder of this project.
4) Go to Run/Debug Configurations â†’ VM options and add: --module-path "path/to/javafx-sdk-21.0.5/lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml
5) Make sure the 'resourses' folder is marked as 'Resources Root' and java folder is marked as 'Sources Root'.
6) Run the game and enjoy!
